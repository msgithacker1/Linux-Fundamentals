= Distros are OSes based on the Linux kernel and are multiple instances of Linux designed for different purposes and end users
= They have the same components, architecture and philosophy but offer their own unique products, services, packages, UI, tools etc.
= Linux distros are widely used as it is a secure, stable and reliable OS with regular updates. For cyber, since it's open source, we can customise our distrro to configure it for specific uses

Debian as an OS:

= Debian is another Linux distro, known for its stability and reliability
= It uses the apt (Advanced Package Tool) package managed system to handle updates and patches
= One of the most flexible and customisable distros, providing excellent system control to the user
= Strong committment to privacy and security, receiving regular updates. Useful for cyber

The Shell (Linux terminal):

= Text-based I/O interface between the users and the Linux kernel
= Using the shell means more ways to intereact with progrgams and processes to get information faster 
= The most common Linux shell is Bash (Bourne-Again Shell)

= The bash prompt by default tells you the username, computer hostname and current folder directory 
= The home directory for a user is marked with a tilde "~" sign. This is the default folder when we log in 
= The $ sign on the prompt means we logged in as a user and the # means we logged in as root
= If no username, hostname and current working directory is shown, then the PS1 variable in the environment (that contains this information and displays it and personalises the CLI) is not set correctly. leading to only a "$" or "#" shell prompt instead of having all the details
= This PS1 variable is useful for pentests because you can modify it to show even more information like IP, success/failure of the last command etc. to keep better track of actions and operations 
= We can customise the prompt by using special characters and variables in the shell config file (.bashrc for bash). E.g., \u represents current username, \t represents current time 

Getting Help in the Shell:

= We may not always be fully familiar with every tool and command, so we can use the man files and help function to figure out the tools

= "ls" lists all files and directories in the current folder/any specified directory
= "man" displays the manual pages for commands and provides more details on how to use them. E.g., "man ls"
= "--help" can help us to quickly look at the optional parameters without looking through the complete documentation. E.g., "ls --help"
= Some other tools, like curl, provide a shorter version of help by using "-h" instead of "--help". E.g., "curl -h"
 = "apropos" searches short descriptions in the manual pages for the tools for instances of a given keyword. E.g., "apropos sudo"


Finding System Information from the Shell:

= "whoami": displays current username
= "id": returns user's identity. Builds on whoami 
= "hostname": sets or prints the name of the current host system
= "uname": prints basic information about the OS name and system hardware
= "pwd": returns the name of the current working directory
= "ifconfig": assigns or views an address to a network interface and/or configure network interface parameters
= "ip": shows/manipulates routing, network devices, interfaces and tunnels
= "netstat": shows the current network status
= "ss": used to investigate sockets
= "ps": shows process status
= "who": displays who is logged in
= "env": prints environment or sets and executes commands
= "lsblk": lists block devices
= "lsusb": lists USB devices connected
= "lsof": lists opened files
= "lspci": lists PCI devices (i.e., any device that connects to the computer's motherboard via a PCI slot. Includes stuff like graphics cards, network adapters etc.)


Using SSH (Secure Shell):

= Allows clients to access and execute commands/actions on remote computers

Terminal Emulators:

= Software that emulates the functionality of a terminal
= Allows text-based programs to be executed within a GUI 
= Multiple of these CLI can be run as additional terminals in one terminal. Can help with different tasks like working in multiple directories at the same time
