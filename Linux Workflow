Navigation:

= We navigate Linux by using different commands and tools to print out information about a directory or a file and can use advanced options to optimise the output to our needs 

= The ls command may not list all the contents of a folder. The directory can have hidden files that start with a dot at the beginning of the name (e.g., .bashrc). use "ls -la" to list all files of a directory 
= To find the contents of a specific path, we can use "ls" to specify a path. E.g., "ls /l /var/"
= "cd" can be used to navigate straight away to our desired directory. E.g., "cd /dev/shm". "cd -" transfers us back to the directory we were last in
